# FinEdge Website
This repository contains the code for the FinEdge website. The website is designed to provide information about FinEdge and its services, as well as to allow users to contact the company.

I started by gathering requirements and understanding the objectives of the website. I analyzed the target audience and defined the main features and content to include.
I used React.js as the main framework for building the website. I divided the project into components, such as Navbar, Home, About, Services, Contact, and Footer. I used Tailwind CSS for styling and Framer Motion for adding interactive animations.
I conducted thorough testing to ensure the website is responsive and functions correctly on different devices and browsers. I paid attention to usability, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility.
I deployed the website to a hosting platform, such as Netlify to make it accessible online. I set up a continuous integration and deployment workflow to automate the deployment process.

Challenges Faced and Solutions:
One challenge was ensuring the website looks and functions well on different screen sizes. I used responsive design techniques and media queries to adapt the layout and styling based on screen size.
Implementing a mobile-friendly navigation menu was a challenge. I used React and Framer Motion to create a responsive and animated navigation menu that opens and closes smoothly on mobile devices.
Ensuring the website works consistently across different browsers was a challenge. I tested the website on multiple browsers and made necessary adjustments to the CSS and JavaScript to ensure compatibility.
